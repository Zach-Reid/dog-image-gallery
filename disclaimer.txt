This was a project from an earlier semester. As I have been told, if I am satisfied with the previous work, it should be re-submitted. Since I am satisfied with the previous work, I am re-submitting it. However, I am not able to answer the reflection questions, since I do not have a way to say the resources that I used for the project last semester, if I asked anyone (students or teachers) for help, it would have been documented on the previous feedback, and I do not have an accurate rating of how hard this was or how many hours it took when I first created it.
